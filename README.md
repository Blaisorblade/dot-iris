# Type Soundness for DOT via logical relations

## File Layout

Code is not perfectly modularized, but here is a rough layout of the various files.

* Syntax:
  - dotsyn_orig.v: Autosubst2-generated DOT SYNtax
  - dotsyn.v: DOT SYNtax, based on dotsyn_orig.v
  - Autosubst2.v: Autosubst2 library
  - axioms.v: axioms for propositional and functional extensionality, as used for Autosubst2.
* Operational semantics
  - synFuncs.v (SYNtactic Functions): utility functions to manipulate syntax (field lookup)
  - operational.v: instantiate Iris with DOT operational semantics
  - synLemmas.v: (SYNtactic Lemmas): lemmas about synFuncs.v
  - rules.v: lemmas about WP and this language's semantics.
* Translation from syntactic values/terms/... to semantic ones:
  - synToSem.v
* Unary logical relation:
  - unary_lr.v
* (Sub)typing lemmas about unary logical relation:
  - lr_lemmasDefs.v: lemmas about DEFinition typing
  - lr_lemmasTSel.v: lemmas about TSel (type selection)
  - lr_lemma.v: other misc typing lemmas
  - experiments.v: experiments on typing lemmas that don't make sense
* Support
  - tactics.v: misc homegrown Ltac automation

### Whence dotsyn.v

That comes from the `dotsyn_orig.v`, autogenerated from `dotsyn.lf`, with lemmas
filled in following the Autosubst2 case study.

Usually one needs to fill in only the proofs, not the statements, with a couple
of exceptions.

### Generating `dotsyn_orig.v`

To regenerate `dotsyn_orig.v` as needed, checkout and install
https://github.com/Blaisorblade/autosubst2-proto, branch experiments,
via stack (or cabal), and run

```
as2-exe -i dotsyn.lf -o dotsyn_orig.v
```

To also produce a graph showing dependencies among datatypes (just useful for debugging Autosubst2 and checking it understands your signature correctly), use:

```
as2-exe -i dotsyn.lf -d dotsyn.dot -o dotsyn_orig.v && dot -Tpdf dotsyn.dot -o dotsyn.pdf
```

## Installation
### Iris version

Install Iris commit 19e8581017fd4d5118a3cb5afc066a55992ecc57, for instance via
`opam install coq-iris.dev.2018-11-01.2.19e85810`.

### To use glorious opam 2.0

One can use opam 2.0 to create a local switch, that is, a local version of iris
and of coq that will only be used when one is inside this directory. _The first
time,_ one should do:

```shell
opam repo add iris-dev https://gitlab.mpi-sws.org/FP/opam-dev.git --set-default
```

to add the iris opam repository, and then, in this directory, do

```shell
opam switch create . --deps-only --locked
```

to create the local switch. Then, every time you wants to work on this, do

```shell
eval $(opam env)
```

so that `coqc`, etc, correspond to the local version.
