### Whence dotsyn.v

That comes from the `dotsyn_orig.v`, autogenerated from `dotsyn.lf`, with lemmas
filled in following the Autosubst2 case study.

Usually one needs to fill in only the proofs, not the statements, with a couple
of exceptions.

### Generating dotsyn_orig.v

To regenerate dotsyn_orig.v as needed,
Checkout and install https://github.com/Blaisorblade/autosubst2-proto, branch experiments, via stack (or cabal), and run
```
as2-exe -i dotsyn.lf -o dotsyn_orig.v
```

To also produce a graph showing dependencies among datatypes (just useful for debugging Autosubst2 and checking it understands your signature correctly), use:
```
as2-exe -i dotsyn.lf -d dotsyn.dot -o dotsyn_orig.v && dot -Tpdf dotsyn.dot -o dotsyn.pdf
```
