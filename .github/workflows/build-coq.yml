# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel.
# This workflow contains two jobs, "build" and "mathcomp", for demo purposes;
# a typical workflow would only contain one of them:
# keep a job similar to "build" if pulling an image with coq+bignums is enough
# or keep a job similar to "mathcomp" if your project relies on mathcomp, so
# an image with coq+bignums+mathcomp will be pulled.
